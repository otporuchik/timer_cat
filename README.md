# timer_cat
Cat helper to watch for time when it's on browser.
Click on cat's body and it'll start moving for seconds from input form at the bottom.
This just for fun to make kinda stub to replace default web-server page.
To start it just clone timer_cat.html and open in your browser, no more required actions.
